      Rhinos are large, thick-skinned herbivorous mammals known for their impressive size and 
      distinctive horns. They are native to Africa and South Asia, and there are five extant species 
      of rhinos. Despite their formidable appearance, rhinos are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.
