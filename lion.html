The lion is a social carnivorous mammal native to the grasslands and savannas of Africa, though a small population also exists in the Gir Forest of India. It is one of the largest extant members of the cat family, known for its muscular build, impressive mane, and role as an apex predator. Lions live in groups called prides, relying on cooperative hunting strategies and maintaining a complex social structure. With their iconic roars and territorial instincts, lions are widely recognized as the kings of their habitat.
