      The cheetah is a large feline known for its speed and agility. 
      It is the fastest land animal, capable of reaching speeds up to 75 mph (120 km/h) 
      in short bursts covering distances up to 1,500 feet (460 m). 
      Cheetahs are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa and are distinguished by their unique 
      black tear stripes running from their eyes to their mouths.
